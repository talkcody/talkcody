You can use your **GitHub Copilot** subscription quota directly in TalkCody without purchasing additional API credits.

## How It Works

TalkCody uses the official **Device Code Flow** provided by GitHub for authentication. This is the authentication method recommended by GitHub for desktop apps and CLI tools.

The authentication flow is as follows:
1. TalkCody obtains a **User Code** and **Verification URI**
2. Automatically opens your browser to the GitHub device authorization page
3. You **enter the displayed user code** in your browser and complete authorization
4. TalkCody polls to obtain the access token and completes authentication

<Callout type="info">
GitHub Copilot uses the same authentication mechanism as GitHub CLI (gh) and VS Code Copilot.
</Callout>

## Configuration Steps

<Steps>

<Step>
### Open Settings

1. Launch TalkCody
2. Click the **Settings** icon on the left
3. Navigate to the **API Keys** page
4. Find the **GitHub Copilot** section

</Step>

<Step>
### Agree to Disclaimer

After clicking the **Sign in with GitHub** button, a disclaimer dialog will appear.

Please read the terms carefully, check the agreement option, and click **Confirm** to continue.

</Step>

<Step>
### Obtain User Code

The system will automatically request a device code from GitHub. After success, you will see:

- **User Code**: An 8-character code (e.g., `ABCD-1234`)
- **Verification URI**: GitHub device authorization page

The system will automatically open the verification page in your browser.

<Callout type="tip">
If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can click the "Re-open Link" button on the interface to open it manually.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Enter User Code in Browser

1. The browser will automatically open to the GitHub device authorization page (https://github.com/login/device)
2. In the input field shown on the page, **enter the user code from Step 3**
3. Click **Continue** or **Authorize** button

</Step>

<Step>
### Confirm Authorization

1. If you haven't authorized this app before, GitHub will prompt you to confirm authorization
2. Click the **Authorize** button to grant access to TalkCody
3. After successful authorization, the browser will display a success message

</Step>

<Step>
### Wait for Authentication to Complete

Return to TalkCody, the system is polling and waiting for authorization:

- The interface will show "Waiting for authorization..." or "Exchanging authorization code..."
- After successful authorization, the status will change to **Connected**

<Callout type="warning">
If you closed the authorization page in your browser, you can click the "Connect" button on the interface to retry polling.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Enable Copilot Model Features

**This step is very important** - GitHub Copilot may not have all models enabled by default.

1. Open [GitHub Copilot Feature Settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot/features)
2. Make sure to enable the model options you want to use

</Step>

<Step>
### Verify Connection

After successful authorization, you will see:

- Connection status shows as **Connected**
- You can view available Copilot models in the model selector
- You can start using GitHub Copilot for conversations

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
After successful authentication, tokens will refresh automatically, no need to log in repeatedly. However, please note that if you change model permissions in your GitHub settings, you may need to log in again to obtain new model access permissions.
</Callout>

## FAQ

### Why don't I see any available models?

Please check the following:

1. **Confirm model features are enabled**: Visit [GitHub Copilot Feature Settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot/features) and make sure relevant models are enabled
2. **Confirm subscription status**: Make sure your GitHub account has a valid Copilot subscription
3. **Re-login**: After changing model settings, you may need to log in again to refresh permissions

### What GitHub Copilot models are supported?

GitHub Copilot supports multiple models, depending on your subscription type and region:

- **Copilot Chat**: Suitable for code conversations and Q&A
- **Copilot Editing**: Suitable for code completion and editing suggestions

You can view and select available model options in your GitHub settings.

### Can I use this on multiple devices?

GitHub Copilot subscriptions typically support multiple device usage, but:

- **Personal version**: Can be used on multiple devices, but only one active session at a time
- **Enterprise version**: May have restrictions based on organization policy

Please note that each time you use it on a new device, you need to complete the device code authorization flow.

### What if authentication expires?

If authentication expires (usually after a few hours):

1. TalkCody will automatically try to refresh the token
2. If automatic refresh fails, you need to complete the device code authorization flow again
3. Simply click the "Sign in with GitHub" button again
