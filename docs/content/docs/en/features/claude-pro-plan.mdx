If you already have a **Claude Pro** ($20/month) or **Claude Max** ($100-200/month) subscription, you can use your subscription quota directly in TalkCody without purchasing additional API credits.

## How It Works

TalkCody uses the official **OAuth authentication** provided by Anthropic, which is the same authentication method used by official Claude clients (claude.ai, Claude desktop app).

After logging in via OAuth, TalkCody can use the model quota included in your subscription, including Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus, and other models.
