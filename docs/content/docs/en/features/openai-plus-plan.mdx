If you already have a **ChatGPT Plus** ($20/month) or **ChatGPT Pro** ($200/month) subscription, you can use your subscription quota directly in TalkCody without purchasing additional API credits.

## How It Works

TalkCody uses the official **OAuth authentication** provided by OpenAI, which is the same authentication method used by OpenAI's official Codex CLI.

After logging in via OAuth, TalkCody can use the model quota included in your subscription, including GPT-5.2, GPT-5.2-Codex, and other models.
