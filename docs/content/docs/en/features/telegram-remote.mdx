## Overview

Telegram Remote Control allows you to send messages from Telegram on your phone, have TalkCody execute tasks in the background on your desktop, and stream results back to your phone.

Ideal use cases:

- Start tasks remotely and check progress anytime
- Get task results while commuting or on the go
- Handle long-running tasks

## Prerequisites

### 1. Create a Bot in Telegram

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
2. Send the `/newbot` command
3. Follow the prompts to enter a name for your Bot (e.g., "TalkCody Remote Control")
4. Enter a username for your Bot (must end with `bot`, e.g., `talkcody_remote_bot`)
5. After creation, BotFather will send a message containing the **Bot Token**

<Callout type="warning">
Please keep the Bot Token secure and do not share it with others. If the token is leaked, you can reset it by sending the `/revoke` command to BotFather.
</Callout>

### 2. Ensure Desktop TalkCody is Running

Telegram Remote Control requires the desktop TalkCody application to be running in order to receive and process messages.

## Configuration Steps

1. Open TalkCody Settings
2. Find "Telegram Remote Control"
3. Enable the "Enable Telegram Remote Control" toggle
4. Enter the **Bot Token** (obtained from BotFather)
5. (Optional) Enter **Allowed Chat IDs**:
   - Leave empty: Allow all chats
   - Multiple Chat IDs separated by commas
6. Set **Polling Timeout** (5-60 seconds, recommended 10-30 seconds)
7. Save settings

## Core Workflow

2. While executing, results are continuously updated to Telegram
3. After task completion, the full result is sent in segments

## FAQ

### 1. Why am I not receiving replies?

- Please confirm TalkCody is running
- Please confirm the Bot Token is correct
- If Allowed Chat IDs is set, confirm your Chat ID is in the whitelist
- A polling timeout that's too small may cause frequent request failures; 10-30 seconds is recommended
- Check if the Bot is active (send commands like `/setinline` to BotFather to confirm status)

### 2. Is group chat supported?

The current version does not support group chats, only private chats.

### 3. How do I stop a task?

Send `/stop` to stop the current task.

### 4. How do I switch models/projects/agents?

- `/model <modelId>` - Switch main model
- `/project <projectId>` - Switch current project
- `/agent <agentId>` - Switch current Agent

Use `/list` to view available options:
- `/list -m` or `/list --models` - View model list
- `/list -p` or `/list --projects` - View project list
- `/list -a` or `/list --agents` - View Agent list
